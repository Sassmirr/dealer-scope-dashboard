# ðŸš— DealerScope AI â€“ Predictive Analytics Dashboard

DealerScope AI is an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** for automotive KPI forecasting.  
It combines **machine learning (LightGBM)** with **classical time series modeling (SARIMAX)** to provide accurate, explainable, and flexible predictions.  
A **What-If scenario engine** lets business users simulate changes (e.g. Sales Â±50%) and instantly see **how other KPIs like Gross Profit will respond.**

## âœ¨ Features
- **Accurate KPI Forecasting**  
  Predicts the next 1â€“12 months of performance using a trained LightGBM model.
  
- **Correlation-Driven What-If Analysis**  
  Adjust key metrics (e.g. Sales Â±50%) and see how **Gross Profit responds dynamically**, powered by real historical regression â€” not random scaling.
  
- **Interactive KPI Dashboard**  
  Live charts, KPI cards, and dealer-level insights all update instantly in response to user input.
  
- **Clean & Modular Codebase**  
  Organized into `src/models/` for machine learning, `data/` for inputs, and a single `app.py` for Streamlit deployment.

ðŸ§  How the Forecasting & What-If Engine Works

Forecast Generation

Choose LightGBM or SARIMAX to predict future KPIs.

Forecast horizon: 1â€“12 months.

What-If Analysis

Move a slider to increase/decrease TOTAL SALES by %.

TOTAL GROSS PROFIT is recalculated automatically using a historical linear regression between Sales and Profit.

All charts update in real time to reflect realistic financial outcomes.
